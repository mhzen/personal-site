ULTRAKILL is a retro-styled ultraviolent shooter that is currently still in development by [Hakita](https://www.youtube.com/@Hakita) and published by [New Blood Interactive](https://newblood.games/). It's my first foray into this genre, and I can say I've been having a blast with it.

Movement is the star of the gameplay for me. It's so fun stomping, jumping, grabbing and shooting the flying rock guy with the green shotgun. The best part is that the game rewards you for all this cool movement in style ([literally](https://ultrakill.fandom.com/wiki/Style_Index)).

Each layer of the game feels very unique, and the bosses are awesome ([Earthmover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce1fNUQHTiQ) is da GOAT.) Replaying levels feels so worth it because there are secrets everywhere, or just for the dopamine rush. Really can't wait for the last two layers, currently still in development.

For a game rocking that retro pixelated PS1 look right there, it's genuinely stunning and fresh. There are some moments that just looks beautiful. The physics can be janky at times (in a good way). My laptop handles it pretty well, with a bit of lag sometimes when there's too much (blood) on the screen.

And the sound? Oh my god, the sound and music. They're so satisfying. Bonus point for having King Gizzard in the cybergrind mode.

Now to the lore. I don't pay too much attention, but there's much of it. I feel like the story doesn't revolve around us; we're just like this OP robot (that's neither evil nor good) that is just programmed to kills, so we did. That speech from Gabriel was awesome tho, I love it.

Weirdly enough, I kept getting Portal vibes from playing this game. I'm not really sure why.

P.S. If you play on Linux, this game runs very well on Proton.

TLDR: So yeah, ULTRAKILL. 9/10. It's stylish, it's fast as hell, and it just feels _good_ to play. Go give it a shot; you won't regret it.
