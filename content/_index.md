## Hello There
I’m Hammam. A student from Indonesia.

Things I do:
- Take electronics apart (and sometimes put them back together)  
- Tinker with hardware and repair old devices (_reduce, repair, recycle!_) 
- Write code for automation, data processing, and small tools using shell and python 
- Self‑hosting services and managing personal infrastructure
- Learning about embedded systems and (slowly) contributing to open source projects
- Play around with retro-computing and digital archiving

This site is where I share projects, notes, and experiments.
