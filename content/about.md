# About
Hi, I’m Hammam, known online as warofzen.

I’m a student based in Indonesia, interested in programming and tinkering with hardwares. When I’m not working on a project, I enjoy diving into music, movies, and books. Feel free to check out my last.fm or Letterboxd to see what I’m currently into.

I’m a big believer in simplicity and minimalism, this website is one example. Oh, and Gruvbox? It’s everywhere in my setup. Send help.

# This site
Think of this site as my digital home, a place where I might share thoughts, ideas, or whatever random things come to mind.

I’m planning to write some blog posts here… eventually. Let’s be honest, though—I’ll probably forget all about it. But hey, you never know, surprises happen!
